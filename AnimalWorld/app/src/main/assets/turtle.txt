Turtles are a general term for organisms classified in the reptile order Turtidae.
The most important morphological feature of turtles is their carapace. The carapace consists of two shells: one integrated with the spine and ribs, and the other consisting of scales.
They inhabit a variety of environments, including freshwater bodies, oceans, deserts, grasslands, and forests. Their diet varies from species to species, and some species are known to eat fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, insects, shellfish, crustaceans, plant leaves, fruits, and mushrooms.
Turtles have a slow cell metabolism cycle and are considered to be one of the most long-lived of animals. The average lifespan is about 60 years and some live over 150 years.
