Giraffe (Giraffa)is a genus of even-toed ungulates in the family Giraffidae of the order Mammalia.
They live in loosely connected herds of about 5 - 20 animals according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors, that fluctuate in composition and population size
They usually rest and sleep in an upright position, but may sit and rest for two to three hours if it is safe to do so.  There are many theories about how long they sleep each day, but it is estimated that they are in a deep sleep position for three to four minutes a day, ten minutes at the most.
Unlike other herbivores in Africa, they do not migrate during the dry season because they can survive without water, only water from the leaves they eat. They can run at speeds of 50 to 60 kilometers per hour.
