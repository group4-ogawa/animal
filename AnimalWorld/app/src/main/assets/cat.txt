Cat is the common name for the domesticated Libyan wildcat, which is narrowly classified as a member of the cat family in the order Carnivora.
They have very good sense of balance, a body structure that is extremely flexible and quick, sharp claws and fangs as weapons, and a very low footstep sound.
Feral cats have a lifespan of three to five years, while cats kept as pets have a lifespan of about 15 years because they are not exposed to threats.
Cats' natural diet is carnivorous. They need protein and fat, and in their semi-wild life, cats prey on  live small animals (mice, rabbits, etc.), small birds, small reptiles (snakes, lizards, etc.), small amphibians (frogs, etc.), small fish, and small arthropods (insects and arachnids).
