The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera.  They are famous worldwide as the "King of the Hundred Beasts" and are generally considered to be the most powerful animals.
They live in herds consisting of one to three males and up to fifteen females and juveniles in a variety of environments ranging from grasslands to deserts.
They spend most of the day lying sprawled about 20 hours in idleness. Although they may be active during the day, they are usually at their most active after dusk.
They mainly eat medium to large mammals weighing 50 to 500 kilograms, but may also eat small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects.
